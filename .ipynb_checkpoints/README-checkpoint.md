Detecting Depression in Tweets using Baye's Theorem

Depression is a mental illness that is not taken seriously in some countries. I grew up in Mexico and I never got exposure to mental illness education at school or at home. As a kid, I felt sad sometimes and I knew about people getting sad because of difficult times, and even getting depressed but I never thought about people looking for professional help to overcome depression. Some people have been diagnosed with depression and don’t take medication to overcome it. They just continue their lives without medication and getting worse.

There are many experiences that can cause us depression, such losing a loved one, losing a job, getting a divorce and other tough situations can lead a person to feel blue, lonely and overwhelmed. It’s normal to get these feelings when we feel stressed. Everybody have experimented sadness at times. However, depression is very different from this. Depression is a psychiatric disorder that need to be addressed with medication.
